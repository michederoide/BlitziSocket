CHANGELOG for BliziSocket Framework
------------------------------------------------------------

v0.0.3.1
------------------------------
- Improved LowTcpServer and TcpClients (many changes)
- Implemented internal SystemMessages (for errors and disconnection)
- Improved documentation of methods
- TODO: Comment on the method implementations
- KNOWN BUGS: If someone knows the values of the system messages (currently
  stored as uints) he could send those messages and use them to execute
  commands which should be prohibited for normal users (DANGEROUS IN CHATS)

v0.0.2.3
------------------------------
- Added the important part of LowTcpServer
- We're now heavily working on the rest of LowTcpServer and a functionable
  implementation for this abstract class

v0.0.2.2
------------------------------
- Added a class for some information on the framework (e.g. version,
  framework name, etc.)

v0.0.2.1
------------------------------
- Added a functional (not tested yet) TextTcpClient for usage as a UTF-8
  message client (uses UTF-8 encoded strings)
- Added special exception classes for better exception handling
- Improved the functionality of the LowTcpClient

v0.0.1.1
------------------------------
- Added a LowTcpClient as an abstract layer for other TcpClient classes
