BlitziSocket - A framework for C#
==============================

This framework's target is to make socket programming in C# easier than it already is.
Enjoy the easiness of this library by using it in any of your network-based applications.


Possibilities
==============================

- Multi-Threaded networking
- Complex data streaming (you can use raw bytes, text or automatically send text-as-bytes or bytes-as-text)
- Network over TCP and UDP (currently, we support only TCP, UDP is in heavy development)
- You can use specialized socket classes for yourself to extend their functionality


Limitations of this framework
==============================

This framework is not intended for people who:

- want an automatic networking (you still have to implement a kind of protocol (Call And Response))
- are no developers (it's a development framework, you see ;))
